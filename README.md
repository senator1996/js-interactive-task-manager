# js-interactive-task-manager
Interactive task manager web application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks.
The application have the following features:

User Interface (UI): Design a clean and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Focus on responsive design to ensure it works well on various devices.

DOM Manipulation: Use JavaScript to dynamically update the UI when tasks are added, edited, or deleted without requiring a page reload.

Data Storage: Implement a way to store tasks, such as using local storage or a simple JSON file. This will introduce you to working with data in JavaScript.

Form Handling: Create a form for users to add new tasks. Implement form validation to ensure the user enters the necessary information.

Event Handling: Manage user interactions with buttons, forms, and other elements using event listeners.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Structure your code using OOP principles by creating Task objects and methods to handle tasks' operations.

ES6 Features: Utilize modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, classes, and template literals to write clean and efficient code.

Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages to users when something goes wrong.

Sorting and Filtering: Add options to sort and filter tasks based on various criteria (e.g., due date, priority).

Search Functionality: Implement a search feature that allows users to search for specific tasks based on keywords.

Asynchronous Operations: Explore asynchronous programming by adding features like task deletion confirmation or using async/await for data storage operations.

Deployment: Deploy your project online, so you can showcase your work during the interview.
